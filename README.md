INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a Financial aid managment system. The core idea of the system is to ensure that any fund passing through the enterprises 
can be easily tracked. This allows for ensuring that any donations towards any causes actually reap benifits. In this system, users 
can register their causes like *Natural Disasters*, *Education* or *Healthcare*. They can also log into specific service providers
who facilitate services like *Shelters*, *Books* or *Medicines* with specific requirements. 

Receivers or benificiaries can log into the system to view the causes and assign themselves to a one they see fit. Donors can access 
various causes of receivers to make sure they can help them. Donators can make contributions to either individuals or to communties
under service providers. Once donators makee their contribution. The specific countrys bank enables a smooth transition of funds.
Thus is done by validating tickets. Once the donor country's bank approves the transaction, the receiving countrys bank has the ticket.
Now the receivers bank has to approve the tickets which the receiver can validate that they have received the funds.

In case there has been any delay in  transfer of funds by either country's bank, the donor or receiver can raise tickets with the 
justice department. These flags help track the whereabouts of the funds and help the respective countrys banks get the exact location
of ticket. They aid the banks to help ensure the receiver or donor track the funds when there are delays.

Overall this is a useful system which can help countries which are going through crisis and have an impact in society.
